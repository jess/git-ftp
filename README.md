Summary
-------

Git powered FTP client written as shell script.


About
-----

I use git-ftp for my script based projects, mostly PHP. Most of the low-cost
web hosting companies do not provide SSH or git support, but only FTP.

That is why I needed an easy way to deploy my git tracked projects. Instead of
transfering the whole project, I thought, why not only transfer the files
that changed since the last time, git can tell me those files.

Even if you are playing with different branches, git-ftp knows which files
are different. No ordinary FTP client can do that.


Known Issues
------------

* See [git-ftp issues on GitHub] for open issues


Installing
----------

See INSTALL file.


Usage
-----

	$ cd my_git_tracked_project
	$ git ftp push --user <user> --passwd <password> ftp://host.example.com/public_html

For interactive password prompt use:

	$ git ftp push -u <user> -p - ftp://host.example.com/public_html

Pushing for the first time:

	$ git ftp init -u <user> -p - ftp://host.example.com/public_html

Using Defaults
--------------

Setting defaults for a git project in .git/config

	$ git config git-ftp.user john
	$ git config git-ftp.url ftp.example.com
	$ git config git-ftp.password secr3t
	$ git config git-ftp.cacert caCertStore
	$ git config deployedsha1file mySHA1File
	$ git config syncroot Output
	$ git config curl-insecure 1
	

After setting defaults, push to `john@ftp.example.com` is as simple as

	$ git ftp push


Using Scopes
------------

For using defaults for different systems, use the so called scope feature.

	$ git config git-ftp.<scope>.<(param)> <value>
	with param := {url|user|password|cacert|syncroot|curl-insecure|deployedsha1file}

Here I set the params for the scope `foobar`

	$ git config git-ftp.foobar.url ftp.testing.com:8080/foobar-path
	$ git config git-ftp.foobar.password simp3l

Set scope params using action `add-scope`

	$ git ftp add-scope foobar ftp://username:simp3l@ftp.testing.com:8080/foobar-path

You can also remove a previously set scope using `remove-scope`

	$ git ftp remove-scope foobar

Push to scope `foobar` alias `john@ftp.testing.com:8080/foobar-path` using password `simp3l`

	$ git ftp push -s foobar

Because I didn't set the user for this scope, it takes the user `john` as set before in defaults.


Ignoring Files to be synced
---------------------------

Add file names to `.git-ftp-ignore` to be ignored.

Unlike `.gitignore`, the pattern matching uses regular expressions (instead of globbing).

Ignoring all in directory `config`:

	config/.*

Ignoring all files having extension `.txt` in `./` :

	.*\.txt

This ignores `a.txt` and `b.txt` but not `dir/c.txt`

Ignoring a single file called `foobar.txt`:

	foobar\.txt


Adding To An Existing Project
-----------------------------

When you run `git ftp init` you'll be uploading all files as they currently are.
As far as git ftp is concerned, your remote host has 0 files.  If you're adding
to an existing project, your host is likely just fine and you don't want to
reupload the whole site.

To start off in the position that your current local repository is already synced
correctly with your remote host, just create a `.git-ftp.log` file in the root of
your remote's public www directory.  Run `git log` locally and copy the last commit
hash and paste it into the remote `.git-ftp.log` file.

Now you don't need to run `git ftp init`, you can run `git ftp push` and it should
return `No changed files for <host>/. Everything up-to-date.`  The next time you
make a change and commit it you'll only be uploading the files you changed.


Testing and Help Manual
-----------------------

For testing mode use `--dry-run` alias `-D`

	$ git ftp push -u <user> -p --dry-run ftp://host.example.com/public_html

For more options and features see man page or help:

	$ git ftp help


Unit Tested
-----------

Core functionality is unit tested on Linux using shunit2. You can find the tests in `tests/`.
